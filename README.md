## Usage

In order to upload a post you must first sign up and create an account with username and a password you can remember. The next step is to go to your dashboard tab in the navbar and once that is clicked you are taken to a form where you can upload your own post and name it. If you would like to update your post, all you must do is click on the title for your blog in your dashboard and you are taken to an update form where you can make whatever change you would like to the post. If you would like to delete an old blog there is a delete option on the same page that contains the update form.

## Features

The main feature of this website is the ability to add your own blog post with having the ability to update or delete those posts. The next important feature of this website is the ability to have a login account and being able to keep your account signed in until you log in.

## Future Development

A path this website is headed is having the ability to have a user profile that is viewable to anyone. An idea that goes along with a user profile is having the ability to keep your account private.
